## ROI Analysis

### Customer ROI

**Healthcare Example: Radiology Department**

**Current State:**
- 5 radiologists @ $350K each = $1.75M/year
- Each radiologist reads 30 images/day
- Total: 150 images/day, 39,000/year
- Cost per image: $45

**With DGX Spark AI Assistant:**
- AI pre-screens and prioritizes images
- Reduces radiologist time by 40%
- Same 5 radiologists can read 250 images/day
- Total: 65,000 images/year
- Or reduce staff to 3 radiologists and maintain 39,000 images/year

**Savings:**
- Option 1: 66% more capacity ($1.17M additional revenue)
- Option 2: 2 fewer radiologists ($700K annual savings)

**Investment:**
- Year 1: $400,000 (system) + $100,000 (support) = $500,000
- Payback period: 7-9 months

**Legal Example: Large Law Firm**

**Current State:**
- Document review: 10 associates @ $150K = $1.5M/year
- 2,000 billable hours/year each
- 20,000 total hours
- Typical litigation with 100,000 documents = 1,000 hours

**With DGX Spark AI:**
- AI reviews and categorizes documents
- Reduces review time by 60%
- 1,000 hours → 400 hours
- Frees up 600 hours per case

**Value:**
- 600 hours × $300/hour = $180,000 per case
- Law firm handles 10 cases/year = $1.8M additional capacity
- Or: Faster case resolution = competitive advantage

**Investment:**
- Year 1: $350,000 (system) + $80,000 (support) = $430,000
