# NVIDIA DGX Spark - Practical Roadmap for Small Team

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines a realistic, achievable plan for a 2-3 person team to build an AI services business using a single NVIDIA DGX Spark platform. Rather than selling hardware systems, this strategy focuses on providing custom AI/ML model development, training, and managed services to clients who need specialized intelligence but cannot justify or manage their own AI infrastructure.

**Core Value Proposition:** Deliver custom-trained AI models and managed AI services using your DGX Spark infrastructure, allowing clients to access enterprise-grade AI capabilities without hardware investment or deep technical expertise.

**Business Model:** AI Services & Custom Model Development, not hardware sales

## Business Model & Strategy

### The "AI Services Bureau" Model

**Concept:** Provide custom AI/ML services using your DGX Spark:
1. Custom model development for specific client needs
2. Model training and fine-tuning on client data
3. Managed AI services (host and run models for clients)
4. AI consulting and strategy services
5. Ongoing model maintenance and improvement

**Pricing Structure:**
- **Project-Based:** $50,000 - $200,000 per custom model development project
- **Hourly Consulting:** $150 - $300/hour for AI expertise
- **Monthly Retainer:** $5,000 - $15,000/month for ongoing support
- **Training Services:** $10,000 - $40,000 per engagement
- **Managed Services:** $3,000 - $10,000/month to host and run client models

### Why Services vs. Hardware Sales?

**With a 2-3 Person Team:**
- ❌ Cannot manufacture or distribute hardware systems
- ❌ Cannot support hardware deployment at multiple client sites
- ❌ Cannot provide 24/7 support for distributed systems
- ✅ **CAN** develop custom models on your DGX Spark
- ✅ **CAN** run multiple client models on shared infrastructure
- ✅ **CAN** provide deep expertise without scaling hardware

### Competitive Differentiation

| Aspect | Cloud AI Services | Your AI Services Bureau |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Data Privacy | Shared infrastructure | Your secure infrastructure |
| Customization | Limited | Deep customization |
| Cost Model | Pay-per-use | Project or retainer |
| Expertise | Generic | Specialized to client needs |
| Response Time | Support tickets | Direct access to team |
| Commitment | None | Long-term partnership |

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk: Model Performance Insufficient**
- **Mitigation:** Start with well-proven architectures, extensive testing, clear success criteria with clients
- **Contingency:** Offer to refine until performance targets met, or provide partial refund

**Risk: Single DGX Hardware Failure**
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive warranty, regular backups, cloud backup for critical work
- **Contingency:** Temporary cloud GPU access (AWS, Google Cloud) for urgent projects

**Risk: Lack of Domain Expertise**
- **Mitigation:** Partner with domain experts, extensive research, client collaboration
- **Contingency:** Bring in subject matter expert consultants on per-project basis

**Risk: Data Security/Compliance Issue**
- **Mitigation:** Follow best practices, obtain necessary certifications, client data agreements
- **Contingency:** Professional liability insurance, legal counsel on retainer

### Business Risks

**Risk: Difficulty Finding Clients**
- **Mitigation:** Network extensively, start with connections, offer discounted first project
- **Contingency:** Pivot to different vertical, consider partnership with established firm

**Risk: Project Scope Creep**
- **Mitigation:** Clear SOWs, milestone-based payments, change order process
- **Contingency:** Learn to say no, renegotiate or walk away if needed

**Risk: Cash Flow Problems**
- **Mitigation:** Require 50% upfront, milestone payments, maintain 6-month runway
- **Contingency:** Line of credit, reduce personal draws temporarily

**Risk: Burnout (Small Team)**
- **Mitigation:** Realistic project timelines, don't over-commit, take breaks
- **Contingency:** Bring in contractors for overflow, pause new business temporarily

**Risk: Single Client Dependence**
- **Mitigation:** Maintain diverse client base, long-term contracts with multiple clients
