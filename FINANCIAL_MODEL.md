## Customer Economics

### Lifetime Value Calculation

**Assumptions:**
- Average initial purchase: $300,000 (Year 1)
- Annual license: $75,000 (25% of initial)
- Professional services: $50,000 over lifetime
- Customer lifespan: 5 years
- Retention rate: 90% annually

**LTV Calculation:**
```
Initial Purchase: $300,000
Year 1 License: $75,000
Year 2 License: $75,000 × 0.90 = $67,500
Year 3 License: $75,000 × 0.81 = $60,750
Year 4 License: $75,000 × 0.73 = $54,675
Year 5 License: $75,000 × 0.66 = $49,208
Professional Services: $50,000

Total LTV = $300,000 + $307,133 + $50,000 = $657,133
```

**Discounted LTV (10% discount rate):** $525,000

### Customer Acquisition Cost

**Components:**
- Sales team cost per deal: $40,000
- Marketing cost per deal: $20,000
- Pre-sales engineering: $5,000
- **Total CAC:** $65,000

**CAC Payback Period:** 8 months (from initial purchase)

### Unit Economics by Vertical

| Vertical | Avg Sale Price | CAC | LTV | LTV/CAC | Payback |
|----------|---------------|-----|-----|---------|---------|
| Healthcare | $400,000 | $70,000 | $700,000 | 10.0x | 6 months |
| Legal | $325,000 | $60,000 | $600,000 | 10.0x | 7 months |
| Financial | $450,000 | $75,000 | $800,000 | 10.7x | 6 months |
| Manufacturing | $325,000 | $65,000 | $600,000 | 9.2x | 8 months |
| Government | $550,000 | $100,000 | $1,000,000 | 10.0x | 7 months |

2. **Raise seed round** ($1.8M - $2.5M) before Month 6 if bootstrapping isn't viable
3. **Focus on unit economics** - prove LTV/CAC > 3x before scaling
4. **Optimize cash flow** - negotiate favorable payment terms
5. **Build recurring revenue** - prioritize annual licenses and managed services
6. **Monitor key metrics:**
   - Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
   - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
   - Lifetime Value (LTV)
