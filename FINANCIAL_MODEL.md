## Customer Economics

### Lifetime Value Calculation

**Assumptions:**
- Average initial project: $80,000
- Follow-on maintenance: $2,000/month ($24K/year)
- Additional projects: $50,000 every 18 months
- Client relationship: 4 years average

**LTV Calculation:**
```
Initial Project: $80,000
Year 1 Maintenance: $24,000
Year 2 Maintenance + Follow-on: $24,000 + $50,000 = $74,000
Year 3 Maintenance: $24,000
Year 4 Maintenance + Follow-on: $24,000 + $50,000 = $74,000

Total LTV = $80,000 + $24,000 + $74,000 + $24,000 + $74,000 = $276,000
```

**Conservative LTV:** $200,000
**Optimistic LTV:** $350,000

### Customer Acquisition Cost

**Components:**
- Networking time: 20 hours @ $200/hr = $4,000
- Marketing materials: $500
- Demo/POC effort: 10 hours @ $200/hr = $2,000
- Proposal development: 5 hours @ $200/hr = $1,000
- **Total CAC:** $7,500 (conservative)

**CAC Breakdown by Source:**
- Referrals: $2,000 - $3,000 (lowest cost)
- Direct outreach: $5,000 - $8,000
- Conference/events: $8,000 - $12,000

**CAC Payback Period:** 3-4 months from initial project payment

### Unit Economics by Service Type

| Service Type | Avg Revenue | Direct Cost | Margin | LTV | CAC | LTV/CAC |
|--------------|------------|-------------|--------|-----|-----|---------|
| Custom Development | $80,000 | $35,000 | 56% | $200K | $7.5K | 27x |
| Managed Services | $84K/year | $30K/year | 64% | $250K | $5K | 50x |
| Consulting | $200/hr | $80/hr | 60% | $50K | $3K | 17x |

---

## Exit Scenarios

### Lifestyle Business (Most Likely)

**Profile:**
- 2-4 person team
- $800K - $1.5M annual revenue
- 50-65% profit margin
- $400K - $900K annual profit split among founders
- Sustainable indefinitely

**No exit needed - ongoing profitable business**

### Strategic Acquisition (Possible - Year 3-5)

**Potential Acquirers:**
- Larger AI consultancies
- Technology services firms
- Industry-specific software companies
- Talent acquisition by big tech

**Valuation Multiples:**
- Revenue: 2-4x annual revenue
- Profit: 4-8x annual profit
- Plus: Value of DGX Spark hardware

**Estimated Valuations:**
- Year 3: $2M - $6M (at $1M revenue, $600K profit)
- Year 5: $4M - $12M (at $1.5M revenue, $1M profit)

**Acquisition unlikely to exceed $10M for this size business**

### Growth & VC Path (Low Probability)

**Requirements:**
- Pivot to product/SaaS model
- Demonstrate ability to scale beyond founders
- $5M+ ARR with strong growth
- Requires significant changes to model

**Not recommended for 2-3 person service business**

---

## Key Assumptions

1. **Market:** Demand exists for custom AI services in regulated industries
2. **Competition:** Small teams can compete on expertise and personal service
3. **Technology:** DGX Spark provides competitive advantage in performance
4. **Pricing:** Clients will pay premium for quality and specialization
5. **Team:** Can attract/retain 2-3 skilled people
6. **Capacity:** 2-3 people can handle 4-8 concurrent clients
7. **Retention:** High retention (80%+) due to relationship and switching costs

---

## Financial Recommendations

### For a 2-3 Person Team:

1. **Bootstrap if possible** - Start with minimal capital and validate quickly
2. **Focus on cash flow** - Require 50% upfront, milestone payments
3. **Build recurring revenue** - Prioritize managed services and maintenance contracts
4. **Stay lean** - Control costs, avoid premature scaling
5. **Specialize deeply** - Become known expert in one niche
6. **Monitor metrics:**
   - Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
   - Project pipeline value
   - Average project value
   - Profit margin per project
   - Utilization rate (billable hours %)

### Decision Points:

**At $400K revenue (Year 1):**
- Stay at 2-3 people or hire #3 or #4?
- Decision based on: workload, opportunity pipeline, desired growth rate

**At $800K revenue (Year 2):**
- Continue as small team or scale to 5-7 people?
- Decision based on: profit goals, lifestyle preferences, market opportunity

**At $1M+ revenue:**
- Maintain lifestyle business or pursue aggressive growth?
- This is a personal decision based on founder goals
