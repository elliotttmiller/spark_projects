# NVIDIA DGX Spark - AI Services Business Project

> **Leverage your NVIDIA DGX Spark to deliver specialized AI/ML services and custom model development for high-value clients.**

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains a practical, actionable roadmap for building an AI services business using a single NVIDIA DGX Spark platform. Rather than selling hardware or competing with large-scale cloud services, this strategy focuses on providing custom AI/ML model development and in-house AI services to clients who need specialized, secure, and compliant AI solutions.
