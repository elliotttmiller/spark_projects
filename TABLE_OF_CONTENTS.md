## üí° Key Insights for Your Situation

### Why This Revision Matters

**Your Question:**
> "Do we need to provide every client their own custom personal Spark device? Can't we just create specialized and custom trained ML models for each individual client and provide our services in house?"

**Our Answer:**
‚úÖ **YES - Absolutely use the in-house service model!**

**Reasons:**
1. With 2-3 people, you CANNOT support distributed hardware
2. With 1 DGX Spark, you CAN serve multiple clients via services
3. Hardware sales requires massive capital and infrastructure
4. Service model is more profitable and manageable
5. You can start immediately with what you have

### What Success Looks Like

**Year 1 (Realistic):**
- 4-5 clients served
- $300K-$500K revenue
- $80K-$200K profit (split among founders)
- Proven service model
- Strong case studies
- Sustainable operations

**This is NOT:**
- Venture-scale hypergrowth
- Building the next unicorn
- Competing with OpenAI or Google

**This IS:**
- Profitable small business
- High-quality service
- Leverage your DGX investment
- Sustainable lifestyle
- Path to $1M+ revenue

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Focus:** ONE vertical initially
2. **Quality:** Over-deliver for first clients
3. **Relationships:** Personal service is your advantage
4. **Pricing:** Don't compete on price
5. **Capacity:** Be realistic about bandwidth
6. **Cash Flow:** 50% upfront, maintain runway
